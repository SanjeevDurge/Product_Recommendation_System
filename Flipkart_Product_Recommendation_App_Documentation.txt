üõçÔ∏è Flipkart Product Recommendation App ‚Äî Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the Product Recommendation App powered by BERT! 
This app allows users to input any product description or keyword and get smart, AI-driven product suggestions from a curated Flipkart dataset.

-------------------------
üìã What You Can Do
-------------------------

1. Explore Data Processing Steps
--------------------------------
Use the sidebar to select different stages of the data pipeline:
- Goal & Overview
- Dataset Overview
- Missing Value Analysis
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization with BERT
- Recommendation Engine

Each section provides charts, summaries, and code insights into how the data is cleaned and processed.

2. Try Out Product Recommendations
----------------------------------
- Go to the "üéØ Try Recommendation" section.
- Input a product description or keyword (e.g., "wireless headphones" or "blue cotton t-shirt").
- The app will:
    - Tokenize your input with BERT tokenizer
    - Generate an embedding for your query
    - Compare it with precomputed embeddings from real Flipkart products
    - Return the Top 3 most similar products as recommendations

-------------------------
